Need to generate test cases for a given function description. 


/**
* Calculates the modulus (remainder) of dividing one number by another.
*
* @param a The dividend (the number to be divided).
* @param b The divisor (the number by which the dividend is divided).
* @return The remainder when dividing the dividend by the divisor.
* @throws ArithmeticException If the divisor is zero, as division by zero is undefined.
*/
public static double modulus(double a, double b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Cannot calculate modulus with zero divisor.");
    }
    return a % b;
}


Provide only the code.
public class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    public void
