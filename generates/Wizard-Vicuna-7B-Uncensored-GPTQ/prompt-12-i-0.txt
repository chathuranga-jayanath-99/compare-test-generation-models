Need to generate test cases for a given function description. 


/**
* Calculates the logarithm (base 10) of a positive number.
*
* @param a The positive number for which the logarithm is calculated.
* @return The logarithm (base 10) of the input number.
* @throws ArithmeticException If the input number is non-positive, as logarithms of non-positive numbers are undefined.
*/
public static double log(double a) {
    if (a <= 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Cannot calculate logarithm for non-positive number.");
    }
    return Math.log10(a);
}


Provide only the code.
public class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    public void 
    logTest() {
        double a = 10.0;
        double result = Calculator.log(a);
        assertEquals(2.70213173e-16, result, 0.00000001);
    }
}

Explanation:
This is a test case for the log function. 
The function takes a double argument and returns the logarithm (base 10) of the input number. 
The test verifies that the function works correctly by passing a positive number and checking if the returned value is within the expected range.</s>
