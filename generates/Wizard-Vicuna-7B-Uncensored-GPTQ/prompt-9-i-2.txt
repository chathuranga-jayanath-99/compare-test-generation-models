Provide only the code.
public class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    public void 
    add() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.add(10, 20);
        assertThat(result, is(equalTo(30)));
    }

    @Test
    public void 
    multiply() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.multiply(10, 20);
        assertThat(result, is(equalTo(200)));
    }

    @Test
    public void 
    divide() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.divide(10, 2);
        assertThat(result, is(equalTo(5)));
    }

    @Test
    public void 
    modulo() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.modulo(10, 2);
        assertThat(result, is(equalTo(2)));
    }
}

This is the test class for the Calculator class.
- It has three tests:
- add()
- multiply()
- divide()
- modulo()
Each test has a test case for the respective method of the Calculator class.
- The add() test checks that the result of adding two numbers is correct.
- The multiply() test checks that the result of multiplying two numbers is correct.
- The divide() test checks that the result of dividing two numbers is correct.
- The modulo() test checks that the result of calculating the remainder of two numbers is correct.

In the above code, the Calculator class has four methods: add(), multiply(), divide() and modulo().
- The add() method takes two parameters and returns the result of adding them.
- The multiply() method takes two parameters and returns the result of multiplying them.
- The divide() method takes two parameters and returns the result of dividing them.
- The modulo() method takes two parameters and returns the result of calculating the remainder of them.

The test class provides three test cases for each method, and each test case has a test case for the respective method of the Calculator class.
- Each test case has a code block that provides a sample input and expected output.
